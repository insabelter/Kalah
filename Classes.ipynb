At the beginning of the game, four seeds are placed in each house except the storage.</p>\n\n![title](images/Board.png)\n\n### Gameplay:\n<p>Alternately, a player selects a house on his side of the board. The player then places the seeds in the following houses in a counter-clockwise direction. If visited, a seed is placed in the own storage, the opponent's storage is left out. The player's turn ends if all seeds are placed.\n\nThere are some special rules, that apply if the last seed is placed in the player's storage or an empty player's house:\n1. If the last seed is placed in the own storage, it is the player's turn again. \n2. If the last seed is placed in an empty house on the player's own side of the board, this seed and all the seeds in the opposite house are placed in the player's storage. This can only occur if the opposite house contains atleast one seed.</p>\n\n### End of the game:\n<p>The game ends when all the houses of one player have been emptied. The opposing player then places all remaining seed in his storage.</p>\n\n### Object of the game:\n<p>The winner is the player who has more seeds in his storage at the end of the game.</p>\n\nSource: http://gambiter.com/mancala/Kalah.html (09.03.2022), http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/kalah.html (09.03.2022)",

   "source": "# Kalah game definition\n\n### Basic definition:\n<p>We define the game G as a six-tuple as follows so that a computer is able to play Kalah.</p>\n<br>\n<center><em>G = &ltStates, s0, Players, nextStates, finished, utility></em></center>\n\nThe components have the following meanings:\n\n1. **States** is a set that contains all possible states of the game Kalah. A state of the game is represented by a list containing two lists, representing the houses of the two players. The first six values of each list represent the number of seeds in the player's houses represented by the letters **{A, B, C, D, E, F}**. The seventh and last value stands for the number of seeds in the corresponding player's storage. The start state of the game is for example:\n\n<center><em>[[6,6,6,6,6,6,0], [6,6,6,6,6,6,0]]</em></center>\n\n2. **s0 $\\in$ States** is the start state.\n\n3. **Players** is a list that contains the players. Kalah is a game for exactly two players, therefore this game's **Players** list only contains two elements.\n4. **nextStates** is a function which calculates a set of states that are reachable by one move from Player p in the state s. To do so, the function receives a state **s $\\in$ States** and a player **p $\\in$ Players**. The formula is given as follows:\n\n<center><em>nextStates: States $\\times$ Players &rarr; 2<sup>States</sup></em></center>\n\n5. **finished** is a function that takes a state **s $\\in$ States** and checks if the game is finished, meaning that one of the players has emptied all their houses. The formula is: \n<br><br>\n<center><em>finished: States &rarr; $\\mathbb{B}$</em></center>\n<br>\nThe function finished is used to compute a set TerminalStates that contains all states from a finished game. This set is defined as follows: \n<br><br>\n<center><em>TerminalStates:= {s $\\in$ States | finished(s)}</em></center>\n<br>\n6. **utility** is a function that calculates the value of the game for a player. Therefore, the function takes a state **s $\\in$ TerminalStates** and a player **p $\\in$ Players**. The value that the function returns is an element from the set **{-1, 0, 1}**. The player p has lost the game when the function returns -1. If the function returns 1, the player has won the game and if the value is 0, the game ends in a draw. The formula for the function is:\n\n<center><em>utility: TerminalStates $\\times$ Players &rarr; {-1, 0. 1}</em></center>\n\nsource: https://github.com/karlstroetmann/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Lecture-Notes/artificial-intelligence.pdf, S.87, Abruf am 06.02.2022",

   "source": "# Kalah_Game Class\n\n<b style=\"background-color:yellow; color:blue\">Comments:</b>\nKalah is usually played with only 4 seeds in every house.  There should be a parameter to control this number.\n\n#### Attributes:\n- *state*\n- *players*\n- *current_player*\n- *display_mode*\n- *logged_moves*\n\n#### Methods:\n\n- *\\_\\_init__(players)*\n- *_show_state(state)*\n- *show_state()*\n- *draw_board()*\n- *_draw_seeds()*\n- *_draw_numbers()*\n- *start()*\n- *log_to_file(file_id)*\n\nThe class <tt>Kalah_Game</tt> is the core of the Kalah game implementation. It contains all information on the game, including the current game state.\n\nThe attribute *state* represents the state of the Kalah board which is defined by the number of seeds laying in each of the player's house and their stores. It is implemented by a nested list which contains a list for the house on each of the two players' sides. The last index of each of the lists is the store of that player. At the start of the game, where the stores are empty and there are six seeds in every house, the implemented representation of the state for example is: [[6,6,6,6,6,6,0], [6,6,6,6,6,6,0]].\n\nThe attribute *players* is a list of the two players that play the game. They must be instances of a subclass of the <tt>Player</tt> class. The order in which they take turns is determined by their <tt>Player</tt> *number*: The player with the number 0 goes first.\n\nThe attribute *current_player* has either the value 0 or 1. It takes track of which player's turn it currently is. If *current_player* has the value 0 for example, it is the turn of the player which stands at index 0 of the *players* list and therefore also has the <tt>Player</tt>'s class attribute *number* of value 0.\n\nThe attribute *display_mode* defines which way the game is displayed in the output console. The possible values are 0, 1 and 2 and are defined as follows:\n- 0: No output is displayed. The game is only logged to the log file\n- 1: The board is only displayed using the print method *_show_state*\n- 2: The board is displayed with the function *draw_board* using **ipycanvas** for rendering\n\nThe attribute *logged_moves* is a list containing a tuple for every move that is made in the game. This list is necessary for the method *log_to_file*. Each tuple has the player number of the player that have made the move at the first index, the index of the chosen house at the second index and the resulting game state as the third index. The start state is saved as the first move in the list, having -1 as the player number and -1 as the chosen house number. As Python uses references, the states are saved in this list by creating deep copies with the library **copy**. At the beginning of the game *logged_moves* looks like this:\n\n\\[(-1, -1, [[6,6,6,6,6,6,0], [6,6,6,6,6,6,0]])\\]\n\n### Method: __init__\nThe method *\\_\\_init__(players)* initializes the game by setting the *state* to the initial state (seen above), initializing a board object and setting the *players* list using the received \"players\" argument. Before setting the *players* list, the received list is checked for the number of items it contains (must be exactly 2) and if the items in the list are both instances of a <tt>Player</tt> subclass (but not of the class <tt>Player</tt> itself). In error case, matching error messages are raised.",

Until the game is finished (the method *_finished()* returns True), both players take turns, starting with the player with the number 0. At the start of each turn, the current game state is shown.

Afterwards, this choice is handed to the private method *_move(player_num, choice)* which calculates the new game state. The attribute *state* is updated with this new game state.
