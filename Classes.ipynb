    "The method *start()* starts the Kalah game. Until the game is finished (the method *_finished()* returns True), both players take turns, starting with the player with the number 0. At the start of each turn, the current game state is shown. Next, the current player chooses one of the troughes with the **Player** method *choose_trough(current_state)*. Afterwards, this choice is handed to the private method *_move(player_num, choice)* which calculates the new game state. The attribute *state* is updated with this new game state. Then it is the turn of the other player. If the game is finished, the method *_calculate_winner()* calculates which of the players wins the game and prints the result to the console."
