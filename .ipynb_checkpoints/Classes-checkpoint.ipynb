    "### Basic definition:\n",
    "<p>We define the game G as a six-tuple as follows so that a computer is able to play Kalah.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "*G = <States, s0, Players, nextStates, finished, utility>*\n",
    "\n",
    "The components have the following meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **States** is a set that contains all possible states of the game Kalah. A state of the game is represented by a list containing two lists, representing the houses of the two players. The first six values of each list represent the number of seeds in the player's houses represented by the letters {A, B, C, D, E, F}. The seventh and last value stands for the number of seeds in the corresponding player's storage. The start state of the game is for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><em>[[6,6,6,6,6,6,0], [6,6,6,6,6,6,0]]</em></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **s0 $\\varepsilon$ States** is the start state.\n",
    "3. **Players** is a list that contains the players. Kalah is a game for exactly two players, therefore this game's **Players** list only contains two elements.\n",
    "4. **nextStates** is a function which calculates a set of states that are reachable by one move from Player p in the state s. To do so, the function receives a state **s $\\varepsilon$ States** and a player **p $\\varepsilon$ Players**. The formula is given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><em>nextStates: States x Players &rarr; 2<sup>States</sup></em></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **finished** is a function that takes a state **s $\\varepsilon$ States** and checks if the game is finished, meaning that one of the players has emptied all their houses . The formula is: \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<center><em>finished: States &rarr; B</em></center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The function finished is used to compute a set Terminalstates that contains all states from a finished game. This set is defined as follows: \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<center><em>TerminalStates:= {s $\\varepsilon$ States | finished(s)}</em></center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "6. **utility** is a function that calculates the value of the game for a player. Therefore, the function takes a state **s $\\varepsilon$ TerminalStates** and a player **p $\\varepsilon$ Players**. The value that the function returns is an element from the set **{-1, 0, 1}**. The player p has lost the game when the function returns -1. If the function returns 1, the player has won the game and if the value is 0, the game ends in a draw. The formula for the function is:\n",

    "<center><em>utility: TerminalStates x Players &rarr; {-1, 0. +1}</em></center>\n",
