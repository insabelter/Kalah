    "The attribute *state* represents the state of the Kalah board which is defined by the number of seeds laying in each of the player's troughes and their stores. It is implemented by a nested list which contains a list for the troughes on each of the two players' sides. The last index of each of the lists is the store of that player. At the start of the game, where the stores are empty and there are six seeds in every trough, the implemented representation of the state for example is: [[6,6,6,6,6,6,0], [6,6,6,6,6,6,0]].\n",
    "\n",
    "The attribute *board* is an instance of the earlier described **Board** class and has the purpose to draw the game UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attribute *players* is a list of the two players that play the game. They must be instances of a subclass of the **Player** class. The order in which they take turns is determined by their **Player** *number*: The player with the number 0 goes first. \n",

    "- *start()*\n",
    "\n",
    "The method *\\_\\_init__(players)* initializes the game by setting the *state* to the initial state (seen above), initializing a board object and setting the *players* list using the received \"players\" argument. Before setting the *players* list, the received list is checked for the number of items it contains (must be exactly 2) and if the items in the list are both instances of a **Player** subclass (but not of the class **Player** itself). In error case, matching error messages are raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "The private method *_show_state(state)* creates a formatted string which represents the received state and prints it to the console. It can be used as an alternative to the <tt>ipycanvas</tt> game UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method *show_state()* calls the private mthod *_show_state(state)* with the current game state (attribute *state*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method *draw_board()* calls the *draw(state)* method of the *board* instance with the current game state (attribute *state*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The private method *_move(player_num, choice)* receives the number of the current player and the trough index they have chosen as a result of the **Player** method *choose_trough*. It calculates the actions of the player's turn and returns the resulting new game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The calculations are implemented based on the following game rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ...\n",
    "2. ... @noah @neelis\n",
    "\n",
    "The private method *_finished()* checks if one of the players has no seeds in their troughes left and is therefore unable to take another turn. If this is the case, the method returns True, otherwise it returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "The private method *_calculate_winner()* counts the seeds on each player's side of the board (troughes and store). The player with the higher number of seeds wins the game. If both players have the same number of seeds, the game ends with a draw. The method prints the winner to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method *start()* starts the Kalah game. Until the game is finished (the method *_finished()* returns True), both players take turns, starting with the player with the number 0. At the start of each turn, the current game state is shown. Next, the current player chooses one of the troughes with the **Player** method *choose_trough(current_state)*. Afterwards, this choice is handed to the private method *_move(player_num, choice)* which calculates the new game state. The attribute *state* is updated with this new game state. Then it is the turn of the other player. If the game is finished, the method *_calculate_winner()* calculates which of the players wins the game and prints the result to the console."
